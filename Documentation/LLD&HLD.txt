- High-Level Design

1. Concurrent Log File Processing
   - Objective: Process multiple log files simultaneously to improve efficiency.
   - Components:
     - Log Reader Module: Reads log files using file I/O operations and streams.
     - Thread Pool Management: Manages worker threads to process log files in parallel.

2. Support for Multiple Log Formats
   - Objective: Parse various log formats like JSON, XML, and plain text.
   - Components:
     - Parser Module: Uses a factory pattern to create parsers for different log formats.
     - Pluggable Architecture: Allows easy addition of new log format parsers.

3. Advanced Search and Filtering
   - Objective: Provide advanced search capabilities to filter logs based on various criteria.
   - Components:
     - Search and Filter Engine: Supports filtering by date, severity, and custom patterns.
     - Query Processor: Handles complex query inputs for deep analysis.

4. Data Aggregation and Analysis
   - Objective: Aggregate logs from different sources and perform statistical analysis.
   - Components:
     - Data Aggregation Module: Collects and merges data from multiple threads.
     - Analysis Engine: Implements algorithms for pattern detection and anomaly identification.

5. Security and Compliance
   - Objective: Ensure secure handling of sensitive log data.
   - Components:
     - Encryption Module: Encrypts sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
     - Compliance Checker: Ensures compliance with data privacy and protection standards.

6. Reporting
   - Objective: Generate reports in various formats.
   - Components:
     - Reporting Module: Generates reports in formats like PDF or HTML.

- Low-Level Design

1. Log Reader Module
   - File I/O Operations: Use Java NIO for efficient file reading.
   - Stream API: Read large files in chunks to handle memory efficiently.

2. Parser Module
   - Factory Pattern: Create a factory class that returns appropriate parser instances based on log format.
   - Standardized Format: Convert raw log data into a standardized internal format for uniform processing.

3. Analysis Engine
   - Functional Interfaces and Lambda Expressions: Use Java 8 features for custom analysis.
   - Pattern Detection Algorithms: Implement algorithms to identify patterns and anomalies in log data.

4. Data Aggregation Module
   - Thread-Safe Collections: Use `ConcurrentHashMap` for storing intermediate results.
   - Data Merging: Merge data from different threads efficiently.

5. Multi-Threading Design
   - Thread Pool Management: Use `ExecutorService` to manage a pool of worker threads.
   - Concurrency Control: Use synchronized blocks or locks to handle shared resources and avoid race conditions.

6. Error Handling and Logging
   - Exception Handling: Implement robust exception handling mechanisms.
   - Logging Framework: Use Log4j for logging and debugging purposes.

7. Data Storage
   - In-Memory Storage: Use `HashMap` or `ConcurrentHashMap` for temporary storage.
   - Export Options: Provide options to export results to a database or file system.
