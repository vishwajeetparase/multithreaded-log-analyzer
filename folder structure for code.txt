Sure, here's a high-level directory structure for your project. This is just a suggestion and you can modify it according to your needs:

```

â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ java
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ com
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ yourcompany

â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ model (For your data models)
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ reader (For your LogReader module)
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ parser (For your Parser module)
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ analyzer (For your Analyzer module)
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ aggregator (For your Aggregator module)
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ reporter (For your Reporter module)
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils (For utility classes)
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Main.java (Main class to run the application)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ resources (For your resource files)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ java (For your test classes)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ resources (For your test resources)
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ lib (For your external libraries)
â”œâ”€â”€ logs (For storing log files)
â”œâ”€â”€ reports (For storing generated reports)
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ pom.xml (If you are using Maven)
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

This structure separates your source code (`src`) from your libraries (`lib`), log files (`logs`), and reports (`reports`). Inside `src`, 
there are separate packages for each module of your application, as well as a `utils` package for utility classes. The `main` package contains your `Main.java` file, 
which is the entry point of your application. If you're using a build tool like Maven, you'll also have a `pom.xml` file at the root of your project. 
Don't forget to include a `.gitignore` file to ignore files that shouldn't be committed to your repository, and a `README.md` file to document your project. ðŸ˜Š
